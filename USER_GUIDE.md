- Set conservative goal attempts
- Share `.plp` file with coach for feedback

**2-3 Weeks Before:**
- Revise attempts based on training
- Finalize warm-up strategy
- Test warm-ups in training
- Export PDF and print backup copy

**1 Week Before:**
- Make final attempt adjustments
- Verify equipment settings

### Training Load Principles

**Programming with 1RM Calculator:**
- Test 1RM every 6-8 weeks
- Use rep max estimates between tests
- Update training percentages quarterly
- Cross-reference with actual performance

**Training Load Guidelines:**
- RIR 3-4: Hypertrophy/volume work
- RIR 2-3: Strength building phase
- RIR 1-2: Peaking/competition prep
- RIR 0: Testing/competition only

**Volume Management:**
- Higher volume (4-6 sets) = lower RIR (3-4)
- Lower volume (1-3 sets) = lower RIR (1-2)
- Adjust recommendations based on recovery
- Track consistency across weeks

### Warm-up Optimization

**General Principles:**
- Empty bar for 5-8 reps always
- More reps at lighter weights (50-60%)
- Singles start around 75-80%
- Last warm-up at 90-95% of opener

**Competition Day:**
- Extend warm-ups if running late
- Compress if time is tight
- Always hit final warm-up before opener
- Don't skip sets to save energy

**Training Day:**
- Can abbreviate for non-primary lifts
- Use full progression for competition lifts
- Test competition warm-ups periodically
- Adjust based on energy levels

### VBT Testing Protocol

**For Accurate Results:**
- Test when fresh (early session)
- Use same equipment as training
- Consistent attachment placement
- Same exercise variation
- Track 1RM velocity for baseline

**Interpreting Velocity Profiles:**
- Higher RIR = faster velocity
- Individual profiles vary significantly
- Re-test every 12-16 weeks
- Monitor velocity drop-off in training

**Applying VBT:**
- Stop set when velocity drops 20%
- Adjust load if velocity too slow
- Use velocity targets, not just percentages
- More objective than RPE alone

### Data Management

**Browser Storage:**
- Plans save to browser's local storage
- Clearing browser data deletes plans
- Each browser/device stores independently
- Not synced across devices automatically

**Backup Strategy:**
- Export important plans as `.plp` files
- Store in cloud (Google Drive, Dropbox)
- Keep PDF copies of active plans
- Regular exports before browser maintenance

**Organization Tips:**
- Use clear plan names (e.g., "Nationals 2025 - Final")
- Date your plans for easy sorting
- Delete old/test plans regularly
- One plan per competition

### Offline Usage

**Ensuring Offline Functionality:**
- Load app while online first
- Install as PWA for best offline experience
- Test offline mode before important events
- All data stored locally works offline

**What Works Offline:**
- All calculation tools
- Saved competition plans
- Game Day Mode
- PDF/CSV exports
- Timer functions

**What Requires Internet:**
- Initial app load (first time)
- Authentication (Platform Coach)
- Records database updates
- Exporting to cloud services
